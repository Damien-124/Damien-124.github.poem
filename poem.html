                <p>
                    Beautiful day my angel of light<br>
                    The sun in my morning and the moon in my night<br>
                    I dream of waking up with you in my eyes<br>
                    Because you're my cornerstone,<br>
                    The happiness I can reach,<br>
                    My radiant beam in the night sky, looking at me with that glorious look in your eyes<br>
                    I wanna hold you with deep devotion<br>
                    I have nobody but you, my paradise<br>
                    With you there are no pains but pleasures<br>
                    And I want to keep us together endlessly<br>
                    I live for that, for you and me<br>
                    Love is the type of feeling that you can't ignore<br>
                    It isn't random, but chosen<br>
                    I chose you as the only girl I'd love and adore and I won't let you go<br>
                    I won't leave you, so don't leave me<br>
                    Whatever you're going through I want to be apart of it<br>
                    Let me share in that suffering<br>
                    I'll put you on your feet<br>
                    I'll tell you that the things that hurt will lead you to your dreams, just innocently waiting for you to reach out for them<br>
                    You've made me blessed,<br>
                    With your smile and the memories of your love<br>
                    We're just two lovers after all<br>
                    I want to be out alone with you<br>
                    Where minutes feels like hours<br>
                    Where time slows down whenever we're together<br>
                    You took away my feeling of loneliness and I love it<br>
                    I don't need anything more but you in my life<br>
                    I wanna be yours , I'd wait for you whenever you want to find yourself<br>
                    My emotions used to be masked and invasive<br>
                    But you embraced me, you gave me reasons to believe in love<br>
                    You got my heart beating for you like a drum, and it's not gonna stop<br>
                    This love of ours, I'll make it last till infinity it's not impossible.

                    Hold me close, let's stare at each other's eyes till we get lost in them. Staring into your eyes is as amazing as star gazing. 
                    I fell in love and it had me feeling lonely when things didn't work out, I didn't know what I was looking for till I found you💖
                    I'd run a thousand miles trying to find the love that brought us together so you will never leave my side and I've tried so many times to get away from the things that make me bad.

                    I found you. You, you're mine💖
                    I've seen too many girls and I want you to still be my girl and I know I could be a better guy
                    I gotta you, my precious gem around💕
                    Buttercuppy, even with your imperfections you still go beyond my scale of perfection.
                    I'm inspired only when I see you and realise all we've been through together and all you've done to make me happy.
                    I'm glad I still have. 
                    You make the world around you seem golden 
                    Only that in the midst of all that gold you're my diamond, my pearl, my precocious.
                    There's don't pass when I wish I was all alone with you. Your smiles exquisite and with you there are no dark paths, only the one you shine for me, my angel of light🥹💖.
                    I hope this makes you smile as much as you've made me❤
